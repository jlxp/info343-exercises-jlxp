# Lambda Functions Exercises

Implement the functions in `js/index.js`. To test your implementations, run the automated tests by executing the following commands in your terminal:

```bash
# do this only once to install all tools and dependencies
npm install

# do this each time you want to run the tests
npm test
```

To automatically re-run the tests after each change to your source files, you can use **either of** these two commands:

```bash
# pass the --watch flag to jest
npm test -- --watch

# or use npx to call jest directly
npx jest --watch
```
