# Color Picker Practice Exercise

Your goal is to add JavaScript to the `js/index.js` file to make the page look and behave like the following animated GIF:

![color-picker animation](color-picker.gif)

See the comments in the `js/index.js` file for details about how to implement this.

If don't have enough time, at least get the initial rendering of the swatches working. That will help you practice rendering new elements based on data you have in an array, and responding to click events on those elements.
